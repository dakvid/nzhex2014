<h1>2014 Election Party Votes</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Earlier in the year, Chris McDowall <a href="http://hindsight.clerestories.com/2014/01/06/chris-mcdowall-hexagonal-maps/">investigated hexagonal cartograms</a> of
New Zealand for displaying 2011 electorate wins. It's a really interesting
idea - you can see the small urban electorates on an equal visual footing
with the physically larger rural ones.
I thought a similar thing
could be interesting for looking at how the 2014 party votes varied around
the country.</p>
<p>The code adapts fairly well. I made alterations for the electorate changes
(Waitakere gone; new Kelston and Upper Harbour) and added in the Māori
electorates in the top left.
The size of the hexagons is relative to the largest number of votes for the
party in an electorate, so the areas relate directly to the number of votes.
The opacity of the colouring is based on the percentage of votes in the
electorate (similar, but not identical to votes, due to different turnouts
in each electorate):
<ul>
<li>100%: >150% of national %age</li>
<li>90%: 125-149% of national %age</li>
<li>80%: 100-124% of national %age</li>
<li>50%: 75-99% of national %age</li>
<li>25%: 0-74% of natinoal %age</li>
</ul></p>

<h2>Big Four</h2>

<p>The diagrams probably speak for themselves. National did fairly well across the country, except for South
Auckland and the Māori electorates, which is where Labour did
best. The Greens have most of their support in the big cities,
especially Wellington. (Is there something uniquely special about
Wellington, or are they doing something they can export elsewhere?) NZ
First did relatively well in the Māori electorates and rural North
Island. (Why less in the South Island?)</p>

<p>Here are the maps in more detail:
<ul>
<li><a href="national_votes.html">National</a></li>
<li><a href="labour_votes.html">Labour</a></li>
<li><a href="green_votes.html">Green</a></li>
<li><a href="nzfirst_votes.html">NZ First</a></li>
</ul></p>

<h2>Minor Parties</h2>

<img src="minorparties.png">

<p>The Conservatives look to have the best national coverage of the
minor parties. ACT is an Auckland party. Focus NZ really was focussed!
ALCP looks to be the 5th Māori party (though their top result was
1.4%, so don't over-interpret).</p>

<p>Here are the maps in more detail:
