In October 2014 I made some hexmap cartograms of the New Zealand general
election results, adapting
[work by Chris McDowall](http://hindsight.clerestories.com/2014/01/06/chris-mcdowall-hexagonal-maps/).

Not having a website at the time, I hosted it on Google Drive (hence
the goo.gl links in the images), but Google has dropped that functionality
so they dropped off the internet. The recent (September 2017) election
got me to revisit the idea, so all the files are now available here.

Incidentally, Chris's work (and in some cases mine) has inspired some other
hexmaps:

* Thomas Lumley [linked to my maps](https://www.statschat.org.nz/2014/10/06/nz-voting-cartograms/) and then adapted it for [looking at election donations](http://www.nzherald.co.nz/money-in-politics-new-zealand-politics/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503790&objectid=11414861). (I got mentioned in the _NZ Herald_! :-)
* David Hood [made some maps in R](http://rpubs.com/thoughtfulbloke/hexmap).
* Joseph Wright [made an alternative NZ hexmap](http://mapdruid.blogspot.co.nz/2015/05/hexagonal-tile-map-of-new-zealand.html).
* The ODI's [UK hexmaps](https://odileeds.org/blog/2017-05-08-mapping-election-with-hexes) (which gave us [hexJSON](https://odileeds.org/projects/hexmaps/hexjson)).
* Stephen Beban made a [more detailed NZ hexmap](https://twitter.com/StephenBeban/status/770677003309678593) (5 hexagons per electorate), and used it for [looking at the 2017 election](https://thespinoff.co.nz/politics/24-09-2017/a-better-visual-breakdown-of-the-2017-election-results/) too.
